So here I am, writing the first post on this blog. I named it 'Not just another blog' because I like to think I'm different and unique.

First, I would like to thank [Alex Palcuie](http://blog.palcu.ro/) for sharing me the informations I needed to start this website, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) for such an awesome, free and open-source software and [John Otlander](http://johnotander.com/) for this pretty minimalistic theme.

My name is Cosmin and I'm from a nice small town called Beclean. I like to code, swim, teach and solve problems. I'm fluent in C++ and starter in Java, Python and JavaScript. What language do you speak? I hit the gym three times a week following [Greg O'Gallagher's](https://instagram.com/gregogallagher/) advices on nutrition and workout plans. I want to start Snowboarding very very bad, but I haven't had the chance.
I'll start the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at BabeÅŸ-Bolyai University in Cluj, starting my career path as a software engineer.

I'm not really sure yet what I'm going to write about here. I think it will be stuff I make, things that entertain me or just my random thoughts. I had the idea to start blogging a long time ago, and I'm very excited I see this starting point.

> Today is a new beginning

And I'm gonna stop here; see you in the near future, dear reader!
